---

### **Step 1: Learn Each Component**

| Component | Function |
| --- | --- |
| **Elasticsearch** | Core search and analytics engine; stores and queries data in JSON format via RESTful API. |
| **Logstash** | Processes and normalizes incoming data using **Input**, **Filter**, and **Output** pipelines. |
| **Beats** | Lightweight agents that ship data (e.g., **Winlogbeat** for Windows logs, **Packetbeat** for network traffic). |
| **Kibana** | Visualization and dashboard tool used for searching and analyzing data stored in Elasticsearch. |

---

### **Step 2: Understand Workflow**

1. **Beats** collect raw data from endpoints.
2. **Logstash** filters and processes it.
3. **Elasticsearch** indexes and stores the structured data.
4. **Kibana** visualizes and allows interaction through dashboards and queries.

Some key information available in a dashboard interface are

1. **Logs (document):** Each log here is also known as a single
document containing information about the event. It shows the fields and values found in that document.
2. **Fields pane**: Left panel
of the interface shows the list of the fields parsed from the logs. We
can click on any field to add the field to the filter or remove it from
the search.
3. **Index Pattern:** Let the user select the index pattern from the available list.
4. **Search bar:** A place where the user adds search queries / applies filters to narrow down the results.
5. **Time Filter:** We can narrow down results based on the time duration. This tab has many options to select from to filter/limit the logs.
6. **Time Interval:** This chart shows the event counts over time.
7. **TOP Bar:** This bar contains various options to save the search, open the saved searches, share or save the search, etc.

### **Step 1: Understanding Key Features**

- **Logs/Documents:** Each event = one document.
- **Search Bar:** Enter queries or filters.
- **Time Filter:** Adjust time range to narrow results.

# Task 6: KQL Overview

### **Goal**

In this task, I learned to use **Kibana Query Language (KQL)** to search and filter logs in Elasticsearch using both **free text** and **field-based** searches.

![3327ee49838ed3b50aa9ffca5295b271.png](3327ee49838ed3b50aa9ffca5295b271.png)

---

### **Step 1: Understanding KQL Basics**

### **Free Text Search**

- Typing any word (e.g., `security`) returns all logs containing that term.
- Searches match **whole words only** (e.g., `United` ‚â† `United States`).
- Use **wildcards** like `United*` to include partial matches.
    
    ![e4ce12cedbed2b6c7d5519d49a000881.png](e4ce12cedbed2b6c7d5519d49a000881.png)
    

### **Logical Operators**

KQL supports:

- `OR` ‚Äî combines multiple conditions
    
    ‚Üí Example: `"United States" OR "England"`
    
- `AND` ‚Äî matches logs containing both conditions
    
    ‚Üí Example: `"United States" AND "Virginia"`
    
- `NOT` ‚Äî excludes specified results
    
    ‚Üí Example: `"United States" AND NOT ("Florida")`
    

### **Field-Based Search**

- Format: `FIELD : VALUE`
    
    ‚Üí Example: `Source_ip : 238.163.231.224 AND UserName : Suleman`
    
- Kibana auto-suggests available fields while typing.

---

### **Step 2: Using KQL to Filter Data**

### **Filter logs from Source_Country = United States and show logs for User James or Albert**

- Query used:
    
    ```
    Source_Country : "United States" and (UserName : "James" or UserName : "Albert")
    ```
    

‚úÖ **Answer:** 161 records

---

### **Find VPN connections after termination of user ‚ÄúJohny Brown‚Äù (1 Jan 2022)**

- Query used:
    
    ```
    UserName: "Johny Brown" and @timestamp > "2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
    ```
    

‚úÖ **Answer:** 1 record

---

# Task 7: Creating Visualizations

### **Goal**

Learn how to convert log data into clear visual insights using the **Visualization tab** in Kibana.

---

### **Step 1: Creating Visualizations**

- From **Discover tab**, select any field ‚Üí click **‚ÄúVisualize‚Äù**.
- Choose chart type (e.g., table, pie chart, bar chart).

Example:

- To visualize top 5 source countries:
    - Use **Source_Country** field.
    - Choose a **Pie Chart** to display country-wise log distribution.

---

### **Step 2: Correlation Views**

![e5f27f38815a495499935f5a373728a6.png](e5f27f38815a495499935f5a373728a6.png)

- Drag multiple fields (e.g., `Source_Country` vs `Source_IP`) into the center panel to compare relationships between them.

---

### **Step 3: Saving and Sharing**

![432f67edc84fff2cb9e6fc7bb6243b1b.png](432f67edc84fff2cb9e6fc7bb6243b1b.png)

1. Click **Save** (top-right).
2. Add a descriptive **title** and **description**.
3. Choose to add to an existing or new **dashboard**.
4. Click **Save and add to library**.

---

### **Step 4: Analyzing Data**

### **User with most failed login attempts**

- Visualized `UserName` vs `action` in a table view.
    
    ![Skaermbillede-2025-06-03-135233.png](Skaermbillede-2025-06-03-135233.png)
    
- Sorted results on `failed` actions.
    
    ![Skaermbillede-2025-06-03-140353.png](Skaermbillede-2025-06-03-140353.png)
    

---

### **Total wrong VPN connection attempts in January**

- Added `action` on the x-axis, grouped by `@timestamp`, and used `count()` on y-axis.
    
    ![Skaermbillede-2025-06-03-141350.png](Skaermbillede-2025-06-03-141350.png)
    
- Identified total failed attempts in January.
    
    ‚úÖ **Answer:** 274

# Task 8: Creating Dashboards

### **Goal**

Combine all saved visualizations into a single interactive **Kibana dashboard**.

---

### **Steps to Create a Dashboard**

1. Open the **Dashboard tab**.
2. Click **‚ÄúCreate dashboard‚Äù**.
    
    ![2b8beb35c48052335e21479f096e2cf2.png](2b8beb35c48052335e21479f096e2cf2.png)
    
3. Use **‚ÄúAdd from Library‚Äù** to import saved visualizations.
4. Arrange and resize as desired for clarity.
5. Click **Save** to finalize layout and preserve structure.

---

### **Usage**

Dashboards provide:

- Centralized visibility into log activity.
- Real-time updates when new data is ingested.
- A clear summary for SOC analysts or management.

---

# Task 9: Conclusion

### **Summary of Learning**

In this room, I explored the **Elastic Stack** and focused on how **Kibana** can be used for real-world log investigations.

Through hands-on tasks, I learned to:

- Construct **KQL queries** to search logs efficiently.
- **Apply filters** to narrow down results.
- **Create visualizations** (tables, pie charts, bar charts).
- Build **dashboards** to combine visual insights.
- Investigate **VPN logs** for anomalies and failed login attempts.
